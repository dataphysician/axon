# AXON: Agentic Exploration of Networks

**AXON** is a framework for intelligent graph and workflow traversal powered by Large Language Models (LLMs).  
It bridges the flexibility of LLM reasoning with the reliability of deterministic orchestration tools—making it easier to build, explore, and automate complex decision networks.

## Why AXON?

When exploring or executing workflows, you often need both:
- **Adaptive intelligence**: deciding *which path to take next* when options are ambiguous.
- **Deterministic control**: enforcing rules, managing state, and ensuring reproducibility.

AXON provides the best of both worlds:
- LLMs are used for **Node Selection**—choosing which candidate nodes to pursue and deciding whether additional actions (like branching, enrichment, or termination) are necessary.
- Network orchestration handles everything else—enumerating candidates, applying node-specific rules, finalizing selections, and moving the workflow forward.

## How It Works

At each step in the network:

1. **Candidates are enumerated**  
   Deterministic orchestration tools present the available child nodes.

2. **LLM-driven decision-making**  
   The LLM evaluates the candidates in context, considering parent state and node rules, and recommends:
   - A single candidate
   - Multiple candidates for branching
   - Enrichment actions (e.g. refining prompts or metadata)
   - Termination, if appropriate

3. **Rules and orchestration**  
   AXON applies explicit rules to ensure consistency and then transitions to the chosen downstream nodes.

This combination makes AXON both **flexible** and **trustworthy**.
